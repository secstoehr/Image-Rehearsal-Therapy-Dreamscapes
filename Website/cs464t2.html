        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>Nightmares are a common side effect of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), especially in sexual assault victims. The Disturbing Dream and Nightmare Severity Index (DDNSI) was used to assess the intensity and severity of nightmares. One female subject was assessed for 35 days: 20 using no image rehearsal therapy (IRT) and 15 using the Image Rehearsal Therapy Dreamscapes application. Overall her nightmare frequency, awakened frequency, nightmare intensity, and next day effects decreased, but the results were not statistically significant. These results suggest that further investigation would be worthwhile with more subjects afflicted with the same problems.</p>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Sexual assault is a disturbingly common problem for people all over the world. Designing a more accessible IRT interface that utilizes computer animation would be helpful to individuals with PTSD that suffer from nightmares. The BRAVEMIND virtual reality system developed by the US Army for helping combat veterans with PTSD allows therapists to recreate scenes of traumatic incidents for combat veterans during sessions. Using the BRAVEMIND system in combat-related PTSD showed statistically and clinically significant improvements in patients. The team behind BRAVEMIND intends to update the system to include scenarios involving military sexual trauma, but this has yet to be released. This study aims to create a more accessible and versatile system that allows civilian users to interact with their own nightmare scenarios (dreamscapes) in order to proceed with image rehearsal therapy (IRT).</p>
        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <p>The participant completed a daily nightmare journal for 35 days. 20 days was without any IRT, and 15 days was with using the IRT Dreamscapes application for 10 minutes per day.</p>
        <h1>Results</h1>
        <p>Althought nightmare frequency, awakened frequency, nightmare intensity, and day after effects all decreased after using IRT Dreamscapes, the results show no statistical significance.</p>
        <h1>Discussion</h1>
        <p>IRT has been proven to be an effective tool in treating nightmares, and it would be worthwhile repeating this study with more participants and a more robust IRT Dreamscapes application.</p>
